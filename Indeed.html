<h1>Indeed Jobs Usability Study</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 60px">For this project, my team and I collaborated with Indeed Jobs to conduct usability testing on the company’s iOS version of their mobile app. The purpose of the study was to assess user’s overall experience and perception using the app in order to inform design decisions for Indeed as they prepared for an app redesign. Indeed was interested to know what was currently working with the app but also wanted to learn if there were any features or content that users were expecting to receive from the app that were not available.</p>

<h2>Interaction Map</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px"> 
    Before starting in on our study, my group and I collaborated together to create an interaction map that illustrated the key tasks and actions that a user could complete using the Indeed Jobs app. Based on this map and the actions we discovered, we formulated the key tasks that we asked of our study participants as well as the key features we wanted to observe and report on.
