<h1>Track-a-Pack</h1>

<p style="padding-bottom: 60px">With this project, my team of designers and myself set out to create a mobile application that would improve the traveling experience of airline passengers who check in luggage. It was the intention of our design to grant users visibility and traceability of their luggage throughout the entire traveling process in order to ease the anxiety and stress of possibly losing their bags.

Our design process was conducted over the span of two months and involved interviewing and surveying potential users, ideating potential solutions, and culminated in the creation of a high fidelity prototype that we tested with more potential users.

Over the course of this project, my contributions were implemented throughout the entire process including user research, data analysis, persona creation, ideation sketching and usability testing.</p>

<h2>Design Specification</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 40px">  
The design specification that we created for the application outlines our overall process creating the application and the reasoning behind each of our design decisions.

<h2>Personas</h2>

    These personas were created by my team during our work on the Track-a-Pack project. The three personas were created based on the results of our user research and were intended to capture our three main users: the business traveler, the casual flyer, and the frequent flyer.

<h2>Ideation Sketches</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px"> 
    The following are some samples of sketches that I created during our team’s ideation process. Before we settled completely on the idea of creating a mobile app, we brainstormed some other potential ideas for how to assist travelers and these sketches illustrate some of those ideas.
