<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a people person.

    That is the cliched line that everyone likes to use but for me the cliche is grounded in truth. With a very warm and genuine personality combined with a powerful sense of empathy, I find myself able to get along with virtually anyone and relate with anyone on some level.</p>

<p>This is my greatest strength when it comes to design. With the natural ease that I experience with people, I am able to effortlessly connect with individuals and hear the stories of my users, allowing me to truly understand their thoughts and their needs. It is these stories of individuals with unique backgrounds, feelings, and identities that I strive to capture with my designs and whose lives I seek to better in some way or another with my work.</p>

<p>For me, it's all about the people.</p>
